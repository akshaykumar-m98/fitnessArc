                                <li>Slowly stand back up, keeping your torso straight.</li>

                                <li>Sit on the machine with your feet flat on the press. Some equipment is designed where you sit in a partially reclined position or even lie on your back.</li>
                                <li>Slowly and carefully push the press away from you with your whole foot while keeping your head and back stable. Don’t just use your heels or toes.</li>
